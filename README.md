Using Hyperledger Fabric to manage Human Aging Genomics Data

Introduction
To develop a robust method for storing, sharing and updating human aging genomics data among different entities like pharm companies, academics, researchers and healthcare professionals so that the data can be selectively shared while maintaining privacy. Users own the data and can decide to share their genomics data anonymously, researchers get credit for their contributions, pharmaceutical companies get paid for their research and development. 

To build a proof of concept for the blockchain based human aging genomics data storage.
The Human Ageing Genomic Resources (HAGR) is a collection of databases and tools designed to help researchers study the genetics of human ageing using modern approaches such as functional genomics, network analyses, systems biology and evolutionary analyses.
